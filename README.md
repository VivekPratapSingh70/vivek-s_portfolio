# [Project 1: Indian Startup Ecosystem Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/vivek-singh-26/vivek-s_portfolio/tree/main/Project_1_Indian_Startup_Ecosystem_Analysis)

In this project I have used Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to perform analysis on Indian Startup Ecosystem dataset. This dataset was taken from Kaggle.com, link for it is given below:
 - [Indian Startup Ecosytem(dataset)]()
   
Full analysis in Jupyter notebook is given below:
 - []()
  
This dataset shows us the Startups which got funding between 2016-2017. We will clean and transform the dataset to perform analysis, and then see which sectors are getting the most funding and how the Startup funding decreased overtime. 

Finally, we will conclude our analysis with keytake aways from dataset and probable cause of the decrease in funding.


# [Project 2: Netflix-Disney Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/VivekPratapSingh70/Netflix-Disney-Analysis)

This is a project where I did exploratory analysis on Netflix and Hotstar dataset.

- Data was taken from Kaggle.com, links for both dataset are below:
  - [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
  - [Disney+ Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/disney-movies-and-tv-shows)
- Different Power BI tools were used to analyse length of movies/TV shows on both platforms and there correlation to amount of content.
- Other analysis were on content added over the years and amount of content as per rating.
